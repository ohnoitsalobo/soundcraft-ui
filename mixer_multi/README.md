## mixer-multi

VERY basic HTML `iframe`s to access multiple views of the mixer interface on one large screen (i.e. faders, EQ, dynamics).
Load the page, enter your mixer IP, and open the EQ and dynamics in the upper frames.  

**NOTE: on the first use, you will need to enable sync in `Settings -> Local -> SYNC SELECTED CHANNEL` in any one view, then refresh the page.**

This is well suited to use on a tablet or other large screen. The iframes will rearrange into a neat column in portrait orientation.  
Double click the black space on the right side to toggle fullscreen.
